# Getting Started
To explore our visualizations, you have a couple of options:

Local Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the production folder.
3. Open index.html in your browser. For a better experience, we recommend setting up a live server.

Using Live Server in VSCode
- If you're using Visual Studio Code as your IDE, you can install the Live Server extension.
- Once installed, simply right-click on the index.html file and select Open with Live Server, or click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the VSCode window.
